# Data-Model-GraphQL

## Project Overview

In order to bring user held data models to the world, we need to ensure data models follow commonly accepted principles, widely used customs as well as universality to be meaningful. This project tracks the building of a global taxonomy, using benchmarks such as IAB Techlabs open standard content taxonomy and CINTs open standard taxonomy.

The open standard will be public, developer centric and widely adoptable.

Tools are being rolled out gradually, with work ongoing on all fronts.
